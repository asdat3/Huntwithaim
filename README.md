### Overlay mode
If you have single pc setup, you should enable this mode in the settings. Cheat will draw on top of everything.  
Also, only in this mode transparency is supported (with fuser transparency is impossible).  
Also works in fullscreen mode, tho it will switch to desctop if clicked in the menu (because it's different window).  

### Player ESP
Chams are recommended to write after teammates are no longer tagged as enemy players or after raid starts.  
HP is: **current**/**current max(is not potential max if hunter is burning)**[**potential max hp after after all burns are healed**]

### Supply ESP
You can choose only your type of ammo, esp will show only nessesary items.

### Trap ESP
Also all types of barrels and darksight dynamite. Toggalable.

### Points of Interest ESP
- extraction points
- normal cash registers
- pouches
- clues
- posters
- blueprints
- gun oil
- **traits**
- Halloween's pumpkins

### Spectating alarm
Can't be turned off. Shows you red frame and in big green number how many players are spectating you. Your teammates counts!

### Mouse-only controls supported
Now can be controlled only via mouse: if you stick your cursor to the edge of the window, or move to the other screen, menu will close. Menu will open again when you move mouse back. And "app exit" button in the settings.
